# VTF Workbench

A tool for converting certain textures to VTF, and create VMTs using templates.
Currently only working for Windows while I look for an alternative/equivalent for Linux.

## What's this for?
As said earlier, converting textures to VTF, and linking them with the before-mentioned templates to generate VMTs.
You can export all textures at once to the desired path (Which is base path + material path) or do it one by one, same for material outputs

## Why you made this?
Because I have a very repetitive workflow on the material creation stage, I usually copy-pasted a lot of past made materials and edited them with the new textures, and that was a tedious job to do.
As for converting textures, sure VTFEdit works, but is slow when it comes to batch-doing stuff, and I don't move any setting, I always use DXT5 for the formats and that's it.

Also, I don't want to depend on online tools for this.

## Do you have any suggestion or bug report?
You can contact me on Discord `@Clb184`. 
If you have any problems, you can look at the console and send me a screenshot of it. If the program closes, you can open a console (Like `cmd`) in the folder containing `vtfworkbench` to retain the console output.
